    "# Predicting the sale price of bulldozers using Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "An example machine learning project with the goal of prediction the sale price of bulldozers\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem Definition\n",
    "Predict the future sale price of a bulldozer, given it's characterstics and previous data of how much similar bulldozers have been sold for\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data\n",
    "Data is from Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data\n",
    "\n",
    "The 3 Main Datasets:\n",
    "- **Train.csv** - the training set, which contains data through the end of 2011.\n",
    "- **Valid.csv** - the validation set, which contains data from January 1, 2012  - April 30, 2012 You make predictions on this set throughout the majority of the competition. Your score on this set is used to create the public leaderboard.\n",
    "- **Test.csv**  - the test set, which won't be released until the last week of the competition. It contains data from May 1, 2012 - November 2012. Your score on the test set determines your final rank for the competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Evaluation\n",
    "The evaluation metric for this competition is the RMSLE (root mean squared log error) between the actual and predicted auction prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details on evaluation check:\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview/evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The goal for most regression evaluation metrics is to minimize the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex. Build a model which minimizes RMSLE\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Features\n",
    "A data dictionary detailing all of the features of the dataset is provided by Kaggle."
